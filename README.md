# CVE-2012-2982-Python-PoC
This was converted from a metasploit module as an exercise for OSCP studying

This originally came from becoming frustrated with no public exploits to use manually for the box Gamezone from TryHackMe. I anaylzed the metasploit code and coverted it to python. I'll post a screenshot with PoC after the final test.
